1. Architectural Style:
Microservices Architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.
2. Components Overview:
Frontend:

SPA/PWA using React or Next.js.
Communicates with APIs via HTTP.
Backend:

Microservices for authentication, product catalog, cart, payments, and notifications.
Message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for asynchronous tasks like order processing.
Database Layer:

Relational Database (PostgreSQL): Products, orders, user profiles.
NoSQL Database (MongoDB): Customer reviews, logs, and product catalogs.
Third-Party Services:

Payment Gateway APIs.
Cloud Storage for media files (S3 buckets).
